<h2>Professional Background </h2>
I hold a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from UC Berkeley, which came to pass from a deep-rooted (albeit, self-deprecating) desire to be a 'jack of all trades'. I started my career in academic R&D, having an internships at UC Berkeley and MIT with a heavy focus on synthetic biology applications. During my internships, the natural curiosity I always had about life sciences rapidly developed into a passion that led to working in industrial R&D settings at DuPont and Genentech. During my time at Genentech, I worked in tandem in Business Operations where I expanded my basic coding skills and developed tools and models for their pharma technical development group. Throughout this period, I picked up a natural knack for the business world and got curious about other aspects of Big Pharma business - beyond what I could see in my role at Genentech. I accepted my offer from Deloitte and recently celebrated my first anniversary. Here, I am a consultant who focuses on life sciences software implementation. Details related to my professional journey can be found on my resume. <br>

<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>
When I'm not busy consulting, you can find me photographing my friends and family at the beach, experimenting with the latest beauty fad, scuba diving on Catalina island, airbrushing a skateboard deck, shopping at South Coast Plaza, creating a new smoothie recipe, designing a graphic on illustrator, helping my 13 year old niece with math, or of course, my personal favorite - taking a spontaneous trip. These are just a few of the things I call 'hobbies'. Stories, photos, reviews, recipes, and another other data generated from theses exerpiences can be found throughout my website :P
