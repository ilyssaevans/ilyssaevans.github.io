Professional Background
I hold a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from UC Berkeley, which came to pass from a deep-rooted (albeit, self-deprecating) desire to be a 'jack of all trades'. I started my career in academic R&D, having an internships at UC Berkeley and MIT with a heavy focus on synthetic biology applications. During my internships, the natural curiosity I always had about life sciences rapidly developed into a passion that led to working in industrial R&D settings at DuPont and Genentech. During my time at Genentech, I worked in tandem in Business Operations where I expanded my basic coding skills and developed tools and models for the technical development group. It was here that I picked up a natural knack for the business world and got curious about other aspects of Big Pharma business - beyond what I could see in my role at Genentech. I accepted my offer from Deloitte during Fall of my senior year, and recently celebrated my first anniversary. Here, I am a consultant who focuses on life sciences software implementation. Details related to my professional journey can be found on my resume. 

Fun Stuff
When I'm not busy consulting, you can find me photographing my friends and family at the beach, experimenting with the latest beauty fad, scuba diving on Catalina island, airbrushing a skateboard deck, shopping at South Coast Plaza, creating a new smoothie recipe, designing a graphic on illustrator, helping my 13 year old niece with math, or of course, my personal favorite - taking a spontaneous trip. These are just a few of the things I call 'hobbies'. Stories, photos, reviews, recipes, and another other data generated from theses exerpiences can be found throughout my website :P
